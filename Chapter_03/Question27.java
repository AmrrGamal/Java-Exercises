 * **3.27 (Geometry: points in triangle?) Suppose a right triangle is placed in a plane as
 * shown below.
 * <p>
 * The right-angle point is placed at (0, 0), and the other two points
 * are placed at (200, 0), and (0, 100).
 * <p>
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter
 * a point with x- and y-coordinates and determines whether the point is inside the
 * triangle
