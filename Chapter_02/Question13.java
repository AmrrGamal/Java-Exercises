/**
 * **2.13 (Financial application: compound value) Suppose you save $100 each month
 * into a savings account with the annual interest rate 3.75%. Thus, the monthly interest
 * rate is 0.0375/12 = 0.003125.
 * <p>
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter a monthly saving amount and
 * displays the account value after the sixth month. (In Exercise 5.30, you will use a
 * loop to simplify the code and display the account value for any month.)
